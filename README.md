# PHPExcel - 2021

PHPExcel latest version, 2.0 released in 2021. I restarted this project as PHPExcel is still in use in million projects and having problems with migrating their entire code. Please support this project. Thanks a lot.


## Credits
PHPExcel by @PowerKiKi was dead. Last version, 1.8.1, was released in 2015. The project was officially deprecated in 2017 and permanently archived in 2019.
